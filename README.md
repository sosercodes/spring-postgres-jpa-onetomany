# Spring Boot, Postgres, and OneToMany

## One-to-Many

A _one-to-many_ mapping means that one row in a table is mapped to multiple rows in another table.


## Owning Side

Baeldung explains about the _Owning-Side_ in [Hibernate One to Many](https://www.baeldung.com/hibernate-one-to-many).
You can find the source-code at Github [Github - Hibernate-Annotations - HibernateManyIsOwningSide](https://github.com/eugenp/tutorials/tree/master/persistence-modules/hibernate-annotations/src/main/java/com/baeldung/hibernate/oneToMany).
